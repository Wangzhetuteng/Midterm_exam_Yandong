                            1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Barcelona
                            and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many
                            in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win
                            the FIFA Ballon d'Or five times, four of which he won consecutively, and the first player to
                            win three European Golden Shoes. With Barcelona he has won seven La Liga titles and four UEFA
                            Champions League titles, as well as three Copa del Rey titles. A prolific goalscorer, Messi holds
                            the records for most goals scored in La Liga (301), a La Liga season (50), a calendar year (91),
                            a single season (73), a Champions League match (five), and most Champions League seasons (five).</div>

                        <div class="desc">From Davos to New York, Jack Ma has emerged as the symbol of China's rise to No. 1 in Internet and
                            mobile phone users. His e-commerce firm Alibaba Group, whose $21.8 billion IPO in New York in
                            2014 set a record as the world's biggest public stock offering, has made a swath of deals, investing
                            in movies like "Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation," creating a sports division with Chinese partners
                            and forming an online portal with U.S. department store Macy's. Investors have bid up private
                            market valuation of Ant Financial, his online financial services arm. In contrast, amid allegations
                            that it was selling counterfeit goods, Alibaba Group's stock price has declined throughout most
                            of 2015 and fell below its IPO price in September, a drop of 50% from its November 2014 peak.
                            In September, Alibaba said in a statement that "The sale of knock-off goods by third-party merchants
                            is a risk that all operators of third-party transaction platforms globally face, including eBay
                            and Amazon."</div>

                        <div class="desc">Tyrion is a dwarf, with stubby legs, a jutting forehead, mismatched eyes of green and black,[4] and
                            a mixture of pale blond and black hair. His unique stare has been said to make most people uncomfortable,
                            which Tyrion tries to use to his advantage.[5] Later, he grows a beard, which also contains both
                            blonde and black hair.[6] After the Battle of the Blackwater, Tyrion has a grisly facial scar
                            that has removed most of his nose.[7] Tyrion is shrewd, educated, and calculating, but receives
                            little respect for this from his father because of his deformity, and his mother's death during
                            his birth.[8] He is capable of cruelty to his enemies, but also has great sympathy for fellow
                            outcasts and the mistreated.[9] Even though he is no warrior, he has instances where he shows
                            great bravery; he has stated that what he lacks in size and strength he makes up for in mental
                            acuity. He displays high intelligence and great promise during his brief tenure as Hand of the
                            King, revealing himself to be as politically savvy and astute as his father, yet receives close
                            to no recognition for it.[10] Tyrion’s deformity was the cause of many problems and persecution,
                            although mitigated to some extent by his high social standing and his family’s wealth and power.</div>
